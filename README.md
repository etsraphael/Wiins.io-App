- On discord, everyone can know more about the company. (History of rewards, future update, special challenge, etc.. )
- Even if your update is not mentioned. Anyone can push a new version which can improve the platform (the administrators can merge if they deem the idea necessary)
- Don't forget to share the project, more we have in the community, better the updates, and better the rewards

## Rule for the rewards

- Make sure you choose the right branch
- The reward will be given only for the owner(s) who gets the validated branch
